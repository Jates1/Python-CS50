#When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, 
# as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py,
#  implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but 
# with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
